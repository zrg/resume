## Senior Software Engineer / Guitar FX Mad Scientist

Thoughtful, thorough and inclusive. With more than 25 years of experience, I am looking to be a good citizen on the internet, and build the next generation of web applications. I strive to understand end-users, while gathering consensus from stakeholders, UX and Product teams to build interfaces that are perceivable, operable, understandable and robust. I am a noise-maker and noisemaker-maker.
